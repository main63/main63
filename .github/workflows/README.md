**Related research paper :** https://www.biznet.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cerberus.pdf

This repository currently has two tools that can be used.

**Hercules**: Hercules automatically finds decryption key for actual DEX of the given Cerberus sample, decrypts it, then decrypts configuration parameters in the actual payload. All statically, in seconds.

**queryCerberus**: Partial implementation of the Cerberus banking trojan C2 communication.

Initial analysis shows that the Android V2 in the source package **is not the latest version** in the wild. It lacks Android 10 improvements. Our research paper covers latest version of the malware. According to leftover files, looks like their development team uses a private GitHub repository.
